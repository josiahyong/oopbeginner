This is a simple banking system that I have made using C++. It covers what I have learnt in my introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and C++. 
Topics covered includes: Constructors, Destructors, Classes, Exception Handling, Read/Write into a file, Operator Overloading, Friend Members, Preprocessor Directives, and STL Classes. 
In this banking system, you have the option to open an account, close an account, withdraw/deposit, check the balance of an account, as well as show the details of all accounts.
